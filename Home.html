<p>Video games are a fun medium that has changed over time. Back in the day, you paid a once time price ranging from $30-$50.
    Now you can pay additional money for expansions and other online items. But we are not here to reminisce.
    Nowadays, some game companies have devised methods to really try to earn as much money from their player base as possible. Such methods include loot boxes, gacha and micro transaction focused games. And there are news stories of people spending thousands of dollars on these virtual goods even though they don’t do anything outside of the game. While most people don’t have these kinds of spending habits, a portion of the gaming population are susceptible. These people are unwittingly drawn to the thrill and psychological factors of spending money for rewards. Young adolescences that don’t know any better are vulnerable to these tactics. These practices can put people in potentially precarious financial situations. This website is here to educate you and make you more aware of your gaming habits.
